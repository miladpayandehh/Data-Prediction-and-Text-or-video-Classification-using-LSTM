# Data Prediction and Text/video Classification using LSTM
Predictive analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that makes predictions about future outcomes using historical data combined with statistical modeling, data mining techniques, machine learning, and deep learning. Researchers employ predictive analytics to find patterns in this data to identify risks and opportunities.

**Classification** is a supervised machine learning method where the model tries to predict the correct label of a given input data. In classification, the model is fully trained using the training data, and then it is evaluated on test data before being used to perform prediction on new unseen data.

**LSTM** stands for long short-term memory networks, used in the field of Deep Learning. It is a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies, especially in sequence prediction problems.
